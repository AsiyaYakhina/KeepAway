# KeepAway

This application has two main functionalities.

1) It allows the user to activate the toy remotely by sending the Bluetooth signal to Arduino inside the toy. As a result, the motors are triggered to rotate back and forth and LED's start flashing.
2) The app waits for the Estimote IBeacon to appear in its range and activates the toy via Bluetooth signal automatically.
